## Using `help` and `?function_name` 


You can get help about a package or function with the function `help()`. Just put the quoted name of the package/function inside the parenthesis.

You can also just use a question mark in front of the package/function name (no quote needed in this case)

``` {.r}
help("grep")
?grepl

help("stats")
?base
```
