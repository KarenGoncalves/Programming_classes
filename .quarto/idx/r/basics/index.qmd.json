load table into R\n\nLoad your dataset (from the preparatory slides `To do before the first class`, [Class1_exampleData.txt](https://karengoncalves.github.io/Programming_classes/exampleData/Class1_exampleData.txt)) and save it to the variable `\"myFirstInput\"`\n\n- Note the columns are separated by tabs \n- You do not need to download a file to read it (use the link in place of the file path):\n  -

will print the first 6 rows of a table. \n- `tail(myFirstInput)` - will print the last 6 rows of a table. \n\n\t- For both, you can change the number of lines printed by adding `n=x`, where `x` is the number of lines you want to see\n\t\n. . .\n\n```{r, echo = T}\nhead(myFirstInput, n = 5)\n```\n\n\n## Functions to check your table\n\n- `str(myFirstInput)` -

'read.delim', 'read.delim2'),\n\tfile_extenion = c('File extenion', '.csv', '.csv', '.txt, .tsv', '.txt, .tsv'),\n\tColumn_separation = c('Column separation', '\",\"', '\";\"', '\"\\\\t\" (tab)', '\"\\\\t\" (tab)'),\n\tDecimal_separation = c('Decimal separation', '\".\"', '\",\"', '\".\"', '\",\"')\n)\ncaption = \"Function names and their assumptions in base r (loaded without the need of any package).\"\ncolNames = cheat_sheet[1, ]\n\ncheat_sheet$Column_separation[2:nrow(cheat_sheet)] = \n\tpaste0(\"sep = \", cheat_sheet$Column_separation[2:nrow(cheat_sheet)])\ncheat_sheet$Decimal_separation[2:nrow(cheat_sheet)] = \n\tpaste0(\"dec = \", cheat_sheet$Decimal_separation[2:nrow(cheat_sheet)])\n\ncheat_sheet[-1,] %>%\n\tkableExtra::kable(\n\t\tformat = \"html\", \n\t\tcol.names = colNames, row.names = F) %>% \n\tkableExtra::kable_classic(lightable_options = \"hover\")\n\n```\n\nIf the column separation or the decimal separation is not the one expected by the function you choose, you can specify the correct one inside the function with:\n\n- `sep = ' '`\n- `dec = '.'`\n"},"formats":{"revealjs":{"identifier":{"display-name":"RevealJS","target-format":"revealjs","base-format":"revealjs"},"execute":{"fig-width":10,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":true,"echo":false,"output":true,"warning":false,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":true,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","html-math-method":{"method":"mathjax","url":"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mathjax/2.7.0/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS_HTML-full"},"slide-level":2,"to":"revealjs","incremental":false,"output-file":"index.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
