main analysis\n\nNow that you have the filtered counts matrix and the design table, you can run DESeq2 by first creating the dataset object then running the function DESeq.\n\nPay attention to always put your control samples at the beginning of the count matrix and the design table, as the first sample is taken as the control.\n\n```{r}\ndeseq_dataset = DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(\n  countData = counts_filtered,\n  colData = design_matrix, # colData means data about the columns of the count matrix\n  design = ~Genotype # basically: expression in function of the genotype\n) %>% DESeq()\n```\n\n## DESeq2 - note on designs\n\nWe used the design `~Genotype`, which is similar to taking the expression level for each gene and compare it between the different genotypes. \n\nIt takes the first level of the factor `Genotype` as the control. \n\nBecause of this, the comparisons we are able to make are only `Genotype_x` vs `Genotype_Control`, we cannot compare `Genotype_x` against `Genotype_y`\n\nUse `resultsNames` to see what comparisons are available\n\n```{r}\nresultsNames(deseq_dataset)\n```\n\n## DESeq2 - note (2) on designs\n\nIf we want to make all possible pairwise comparisons, we need to add a `0` to the design function. \n\n```{r}\ndeseq_dataset2 = DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(\n  countData = counts_filtered,\n  colData = design_matrix, \n  design = ~0 + Genotype # basically: expression in function of the genotype\n) %>% DESeq()\n\nresultsNames(deseq_dataset2) \n```\n\n## DESeq2 - note (3) on designs \n\nIf your samples are defined by 2 factors, say `Genotype` and `Age` (both present int the `design_matrix` data.frame), you can set the design to either:\n\n- `~Genotype + Age` - you will be able to compare `genotype1` against `genotype2`, and `age1` against `age2`, but not `genotype1_age1` against `genotype1_age2`\n\n. . .\n\n- `~Genotype + Age + Genotype:Age` - models the differences:\n  - Between genotypes at the first `Age` value\n  - Between different time points (grouping all genotypes)\n  - Genotype-specific across the levels of `Age`.\n\n## DESeq2 - note (4) on designs\n\nIf you have a time series experiment, then you need to add a \"reduced\" design in the `DESeq` function: \n  \n```{.r}\ndeseq_dataset = DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(\n  countData = counts_filtered,\n  colData = design_matrix, \n  design = ~Genotype + Age + Genotype:Age\n) %>% \n  DESeq(test=\"LRT\", # likelyhood ratio test\n        reduced = ~ Genotype + Age)\n```\n\n## DESeq2 results\n\nNow the main part of the analysis is done, we use the function `results` to access the results and inform the type of stats you want performed. \n\n```{r}\nresultsNames(deseq_dataset)\nname_result = resultsNames(deseq_dataset)\n```\n\n```{r}\n# Remove the first element of name_result, since it is just the intercept\n\nresults_DESeq2 <- \n  lapply(name_result[-1], \\(comparison) {\n    results(deseq_dataset, \n            name = comparison,\n            pAdjustMethod = \"BH\")@listData %>%\n      as_tibble() %>%\n      mutate(\n        # We need to add the gene names\n        Gene_name = rownames(counts_filtered),\n        # We classify the genes by deregulation\n        State = case_when(\n          log2FoldChange < 2 ~ \"Down-regulated\",\n          log2FoldChange > 2 ~ \"Up-regulated\",\n          .default = \"equal\"),\n        # Indicate from which comparison the data comes from\n        Contrast = comparison\n      )\n  }) %>%\n  list_rbind() \n  \nhead(results_DESeq2)\n```\n\n# Simple summary\n\n- How many genes are deregulated in each comparison?\n\n```{r}\nresults_DESeq2  %>%\n  filter(padj < 0.01) %>%\n  group_by(Contrast) %>%\n  dplyr::count()\n```\n\n. . .\n\n- How many genes are up and how many down-regulated?\n\n```{r}\nresults_DESeq2 %>%\n  filter(padj < 0.01) %>%\n  group_by(Contrast, State) %>%\n  dplyr::count()\n```\n\n\n## Resources\n\n- ARTICLES\n    -
