The basic ones you already know:\n\n- vectors have one dimension and data inside has to be all the same type: character vector; numeric vector; factor vector\n- matrices: vectors, but with columns and rows\n- data.frames: table made of vectors (columns) of the same size\n- lists: anything goes! If the objects stored in it have names, you can access them like `list$object_name`, as if the object inside was a column of a table\n\n. . .\n\nTo check the class of an object you can use:\n\n```{.r}\nclass(object)\n```\n\n. . .\n\nA package may create it's own object class. Sometimes you need to convert an object from one class to another, like:\n```{r}\n(numeric_vector <- 1:10)\nclass(numeric_vector)\n\n(character_vector <- as.character(numeric_vector)) # change class\nclass(character_vector)\n```\n\n. . .\n\nSo, just remember that, if a function starts with `as.`, it is changing the class of the object.\n\n## Reading and writing fasta files\n\nIf you have protein sequences in a fasta file, copy it to your `inputs` folder, else use the following:  [Reductases.fasta](https://karengoncalves.github.io/Programming_classes/exampleData/Reductases.fasta)\n\n```{r}\n# To open a fasta file with multiple sequences, use the function readDNAStringSet() or readAAStringSet()\nfasta_input = \"https://karengoncalves.github.io/Programming_classes/exampleData/Reductases.fasta\" %>%\n\treadAAStringSet(format = \"fasta\")\nhead(fasta_input)\n\n# If you want to select just one or two sequences and export it, you can do:\nwriteXStringSet(fasta_input[1:3], \n\t\tfilepath = \"input_subset.fasta\", \n\t\tformat = \"fasta\")\n```\n\n## Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA)\n\nMake things easy for yourself later, add the names of the parameters of each function so you know what you need to put next time.\n\n- There are 4 functions for MSA:\n\t- `msaClustalW` - ClustalW is a general purpose multiple alignment program for DNA or proteins. [<sup>1</sup>](http://www.clustal.org/download/clustalw_help.txt)\n\t\t- `cluster` parameter can be either Neighbor Joining (`\"nj\"`) or Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic mean (`\"upgma\"`)\n\t\t\t- Do not use `\"upgma\"` if you are on windows and your R version is 4.x (x being any number) - R crashes\n\t- `msaClustalOmega` - New MSA tool that uses seeded guide trees and HMM profile-profile techniques to generate alignments. Suitable for medium-large alignments.[<sup>2</sup>](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/)\n\t\t- default `substitutionMatrix`: `\"Gonnet\"`; other options: `\"BLOSUM30\"`, `\"BLOSUM40`, `\"BLOSUM50\"`, `\"BLOSUM65\"` and `\"BLOSUM80\"`.\n\t- `msaMuscle` - Accurate MSA tool, especially good with proteins. Suitable for medium alignments.[<sup>2</sup>](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/)\n\t\t- `cluster` parameter can be either NJ (`\"neighborjoining\"`) or UPGMA (`\"upgma\"`) - UPGMA gives better results [<sup>3</sup>](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC517706/)\n\t- `msa` - you can set the method with the argument `method` or just put the sequences and use the default (`\"Clustalw\"`) (other options: `\"ClustalOmega\"`, `\"Muscle\"`)\n\n- Add `verbose = T` so that the parameters used are printed to the screen and you can take note for your publications.\n\n## Running MSA\n\n```{r}\n# The dataset used as example has 48 sequences, we will subset it for the alignment, selecting only 10\nfasta_for_alignment <- fasta_input[1:10]\n# use ?msa to know what you need to put in the function and what the default values are\nmyFirstAlignment <- msa(fasta_for_alignment, \n\t\t\tmethod = \"ClustalOmega\",\n\t\t\tverbose = T\n)\n\nmyFirstAlignment\n```\n\n:::{.callout-note}\n\n# Visualizing the result\n\nJust calling the MSA result will not show the whole alignment. For that you can use `print()`\n\n```{.r}\nprint(myFirstAlignment, show = \"complete\", showConsensus = T)\n```\n:::\n\n## Use ggmsa for visualization\n\nTo see the alignment as a plot, we can use `ggmsa`.\n\n:::{.callout-note}\n\nWe need to change the type of object of the alignment result, as `ggmsa` only accepts `\"AAMultipleAlignment\"` objects\n\n:::\n\n```{r}\n# The original result is of class MsaAAMultipleAlignment\nmyFirstAlignment2 <- myFirstAlignment # keep the original, make a copy to modify it\nclass(myFirstAlignment2) <-  \"AAMultipleAlignment\"\n\n# We will plot only a part of the alignment - from the AA 220 to the AA 250 - so it is visible \nggmsa(myFirstAlignment2, \n      start = 220, end = 250, \n      seq_name = T)\n\n# We can see also the consensus highlighted\nggmsa(myFirstAlignment2, \n      start = 220, end = 250, \n      seq_name = T, consensus_views = T)\n\n# Remove the # below if you want to save the figure\n#ggsave(\"First_alignment_consensus_220_250.tiff\")\n```\n\n## More `ggmsa` options\n\n:::{.panel-tabset}\n\n# Residue size\n\nWe can set the width of the characters (use `char_width = #`), so the residues are not so big\n\n```{r}\nggmsa(myFirstAlignment2, \n      start = 220, end = 250, \n      seq_name = T, char_width = 0.5)\n\n```\n\n# SeqLogo\n\nA seqlogo is a plot with letters on top of each other representing their frequency at each position in the alignment.

But we need to, again, transform the type of object we got from the `msa`.\n\nThen we calculate a distance matrix.\n\n:::{.callout-tip}\nA distance matrix shows how different each sequence is from the others. It has as many rows as columns, since every sequence is compared to the others. \n\n- Its diagonal is all `0`s, since the difference between a sequence and itself is `0`. \n- The other rows and columns are values that indicate the amount of mismatches between two sequences. The greater the number, the less similar the two sequences are.\n\n:::\n\n```{r}\n# We need to first export the alignment and import it again to transform it \nmyFirstAlignment3 <- \n\tmyFirstAlignment %>% as.phyDat()\n\n# Then, we create a distance matrix\ndistance_alignment <- \n\tdist.ml(x = myFirstAlignment3, \n\t\tmodel = \"Blosum62\")\n```\n\n\n## Tree computation\n\nThen, we use the distance matrix to compute the tree, joining sequences most similar, then joining groups of sequences.

In simple terms, bootstrap is repetition. In more complicated terms, the tree computation (including the calculation of the distance matrix) is repeated *n times*<sup>`1`</sup>, and the result shows the proportion of times the node appeared.\n\nIf out of 1000 times, a given group appears 100 times, its support is 10%.\n\n<sup>`1`</sup> n is determined by the number of sequences you are working with. \n\n- n is the number of times the calculation was repeated, so it includes the first time.

The basic ones you already know:\n\n- vectors have one dimension and data inside has to be all the same type: character vector; numeric vector; factor vector\n- matrices: vectors, but with columns and rows\n- data.frames: table made of vectors (columns) of the same size\n- lists: anything goes! If the objects stored in it have names, you can access them like `list$object_name`, as if the object inside was a column of a table\n\n. . .\n\nTo check the class of an object you can use:\n\n```{.r}\nclass(object)\n```\n\n. . .\n\nA package may create it's own object class. Sometimes you need to convert an object from one class to another, like:\n```{r}\n(numeric_vector <- 1:10)\nclass(numeric_vector)\n\n(character_vector <- as.character(numeric_vector)) # change class\nclass(character_vector)\n```\n\n. . .\n\nSo, just remember that, if a function starts with `as.`, it is changing the class of the object.\n\n## Reading and writing fasta files\n\nIf you have protein sequences in a fasta file, copy it to your `inputs` folder, else use the following:  [Reductases.fasta](https://karengoncalves.github.io/Programming_classes/exampleData/Reductases.fasta)\n\n```{r}\n# To open a fasta file with multiple sequences, use the function readDNAStringSet() or readAAStringSet()\nfasta_input = \"https://karengoncalves.github.io/Programming_classes/exampleData/Reductases.fasta\" %>%\n\treadAAStringSet(format = \"fasta\")\nhead(fasta_input)\n\n# If you want to select just one or two sequences and export it, you can do:\nwriteXStringSet(fasta_input[1:3], \n\t\tfilepath = \"input_subset.fasta\", \n\t\tformat = \"fasta\")\n```\n\n## Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA)\n\nMake things easy for yourself later, add the names of the parameters of each function so you know what you need to put next time.\n\n- There are 4 functions for MSA:\n\t- `msaClustalW` - ClustalW is a general purpose multiple alignment program for DNA or proteins. [<sup>1</sup>](http://www.clustal.org/download/clustalw_help.txt)\n\t\t- `cluster` parameter can be either Neighbor Joining (`\"nj\"`) or Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic mean (`\"upgma\"`)\n\t\t\t- Do not use `\"upgma\"` if you are on windows and your R version is 4.x (x being any number) - R crashes\n\t- `msaClustalOmega` - New MSA tool that uses seeded guide trees and HMM profile-profile techniques to generate alignments.

Suitable for medium alignments.[<sup>2</sup>](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/)\n\t\t- `cluster` parameter can be either NJ (`\"neighborjoining\"`) or UPGMA (`\"upgma\"`) - UPGMA gives better results [<sup>3</sup>](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC517706/)\n\t- `msa` - you can set the method with the argument `method` or just put the sequences and use the default (`\"Clustalw\"`) (other options: `\"ClustalOmega\"`, `\"Muscle\"`)\n\n- Add `verbose = T` so that the parameters used are printed to the screen and you can take note for your publications.\n\n## Running MSA\n\n```{r}\n# The dataset used as example has 48 sequences, we will subset it for the alignment, selecting only 10\nfasta_for_alignment <- fasta_input[1:10]\n# use ?msa to know what you need to put in the function and what the default values are\nmyFirstAlignment <- msa(fasta_for_alignment, \n\t\t\tmethod = \"ClustalOmega\",\n\t\t\tverbose = T\n)\n\nmyFirstAlignment\n```\n\n:::{.callout-note}\n\n# Visualizing the result\n\nJust calling the MSA result will not show the whole alignment.

In simple terms, bootstrap is repetition. In more complicated terms, the tree computation (including the calculation of the distance matrix) is repeated *n times*<sup>`1`</sup>, and the result shows the proportion of times the node appeared.\n\nIf out of 1000 times, a given group appears 100 times, its support is 10%.\n\n<sup>`1`</sup> n is determined by the number of sequences you are working with. \n\n- n is the number of times the calculation was repeated, so it includes the first time. That is why you may see it reported as 'bootstrap was performed with 999 replicates' (plus the original tree calculation, you get 1&nbsp;000 replicates)\n- Although more is better, using n=10&nbsp;000 for a tree of 10 sequences is overkill and may take too much time to calculate.\n- The most typical n used (for < 50 sequences in a tree) is 999\n\n## Bootstrap support\n\nLet's consider that we want to use `upgma` to calculate our tree and we want to calculate the support of the branches.\n\n:::{.panel-tabset}\n\n# Computation\n\nWe use the function `bootstrap.phyDat` the same way we use `sapply`: using this dataset, perform this set of functions.\n\n```{r}\nupgma_tree <- myFirstAlignment3 |>\n\tdist.ml() |> upgma()\nbs_upgma <- bootstrap.phyDat(\n\tmyFirstAlignment3, \n\tbs = 100, \\(x){\n\t\tdist.ml (x) |> upgma()\n\t})\n\nbs_plot <- plotBS(upgma_tree, bs_upgma)\n# The data stored in bs_plot is exactly what we need for ggtree\n```\n\n# Tree preparation\n\nSince this is a new file, we need to correct the sequence names again.\n\nWe also set a threshold for bootstrap.
